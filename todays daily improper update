well, I thought it best to do the wrong thing rather than do nothing all. I must over come this thinking at every step of the way it seems,
seeing as this is necessary to progess it's an achievement to me to do even this. so here we are again today doing it! i have a goal, to finish about half an hrs worth of
modules and be ready to start and finish fortune cookie thing before I leave the house tomorrow late morningish. work will probably get in the way so situation remains
dynamic.
